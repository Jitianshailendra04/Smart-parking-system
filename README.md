##  IOT- Based Smart-parking-system.


## Problem Statement
As the population has been increasing tremendously, Four wheeler traffic and its parking has become an issue of great concern. In public places where there are many visitors, a lot of time is wasted for searching parking slots. Also, a lot of manual labour is required to look after the existing parking arrangement. Moreover, there is no way of knowing whether a vacant parking space is available or not. The smart parking system is going to be implemented in several countries. In India, this type of parking system is most likely to be implemented in Bangalore in the near future. 

## Proposed Solution
The given automatic parking system which is safe, speedy, user-friendly and cost-effective includes the following features:
* Automated parking system without any manual labour
*	Simultaneous operations on different floors for car parking
*	Multiple entry and exit points
## Basic Components and Softwares used
* Arduino Uno to be used as the microcontroller
* IR Sensors to detect the presence of a vehicle near entry or exit
* IR Sensors to detect occupancy in each parking space
* Servo motors to be used as shafts 
* Arduino IDE for firmware development 
* LCD Displya.

## Working
When a vehicle arrives in front of IR sensor it sends a signal to servo motor which rotates 90 degrees up and allows the car to enter inside. Once the capacity of the system is full no more vehicle is allowed inside.The exit and entry system work simultaneously with the help of a counter which increments or decrements as a vehicle enters or leaves the parking slot. The IR sensors help to identify filled and empty spaces.
